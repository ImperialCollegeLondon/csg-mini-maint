This component is the bootstrapping code - having written the first version
of minimaint (in ../csg-mini-maint), I thought about how to best get minimaint
to start on a new freshly installed Ubuntu 16.04 machine (not necessarily in
DoC).

I set up a fresh minimaint site config for "this site", in
../csg-mini-maint-dcw-config and a public git repo:
https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/csg-mini-maint-dcw-config.git

Note that this is entirely separate from the minimaint source code, which is
another git repo.

Then, I thought about it and realised that the BEGIN code from sbin/minimaint
is pretty much what's needed for the bootstrapping, so I copied it here,
tweaked it a bit, and thus made the bootstrap script "bootstrap/bootstrap".

I added code to it that:

- installs a few prerequisite packages

- then reads the one-line bootstrap/config.url file telling it where to
  fetch the site config git repo

- then lets the user (for now) choose the machine's instance hostname
  (in order to determine, via the site config repo's hostclass file,
  what configuration should apply to this machine).

- then it clones the given site config repo via git into /etc/minimaint,

- then it reads the phase1 config file from inside that cloned repo,
  determines where to fetch minimaint itself from (a second git repo - the
  "gitrepo" property in /etc/minitmaint/phase1), and goes off and clones it.

- it then refreshes the /sbin/minimaint symlink to point at the cached
  CACHEDIR/ubuntu-16.04/sbin/minimaint script

- and finally runs "minimaint hello" to show that it works.

Did this mainly on Fri 6th July, although added more polish on Monday 9th
and Tuesday 10th too.  Probably only 100 lines of fresh code, as most was a
copy of parts of sbin/minimaint so doesn't really count:-)

Added a Makefile to tar up the bootstrap directory (containing only the
2 files: config.url and bootstrap) and install it temporarily in
https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dcw/bootstrap.tgz.

Now, to install minimaint, as root on a new Ubuntu 16.04 machine, all you do
is:

cd /tmp
wget https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dcw/bootstrap16.04.tgz
tar xzf bootstrap.tgz
cd bootstrap

[check the config.url file contains the correct URL of your site repo,
 now's the time to change this to another URL if you want]

./bootstrap

For 18.04, do:

	wget https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dcw/bootstrap16.04.tgz

instead..
